# Cortex Goals: Automatic Economic Context Supply for Claude Code

## Primary Mission

Transform Claude Code from a context-lacking assistant to an architecturally-aware development partner through **automatic economic context supply** - delivering the right architectural and structural context for every query without manual intervention.

## The 80/20 Problem We're Solving

### üéØ **80% Impact (What We're Fixing)**
- Claude Code suggestions that break existing architecture
- Missing critical dependencies causing runtime errors  
- Code inconsistent with project patterns and conventions
- Development friction and eroded trust in AI assistance
- Constant need to correct Claude Code's architectural misconceptions

### üîç **20% Root Cause (What We're Targeting)**
**Manual and inefficient foundational context supply** - Claude Code lacks architectural and structural context at the moment of generation.

## Core Goals

### Goal 1: **Automatic Architectural Discovery**
**Eliminate manual context preparation through intelligent architectural analysis**

**What This Means:**
- Automatically identify critical architectural patterns and conventions
- Discover project-specific dependencies and relationships
- Surface structural information relevant to each query
- Understand codebase organization and design patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero manual file selection for architectural context
- Automatic discovery of relevant dependencies and patterns
- Query-aware architectural context identification
- 95%+ accuracy in identifying relevant structural information

### Goal 2: **Economic Context Delivery** 
**Provide essential architectural understanding without context window waste**

**What This Means:**
- Deliver only the critical architectural context needed for each query
- Optimize context packaging for maximum architectural insight per token
- Avoid context window contamination with irrelevant structural information
- Focus on foundational understanding, not exhaustive code details

**Success Criteria:**
- 80-90% reduction in manual context explanation overhead
- Context window usage optimized for architectural understanding
- Essential structural information always available
- No wasted tokens on irrelevant architectural details

### Goal 3: **Query-Aware Intelligence**
**Tailor architectural context to the specific task being asked**

**What This Means:**
- Different architectural context for different types of queries
- Authentication queries ‚Üí security patterns and middleware context
- Database queries ‚Üí data layer architecture and connection patterns  
- API queries ‚Üí service layer structure and interface patterns
- UI queries ‚Üí component architecture and state management patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- Context relevance matches query intent 95%+ of the time
- Different query types receive appropriate architectural context
- No generic architectural information that doesn't apply to current task
- Adaptive context based on development phase and focus area

### Goal 4: **Consistency Assurance**
**Ensure Claude Code always has proper foundational architectural understanding**

**What This Means:**
- Reliable architectural context supply for every interaction
- Consistent understanding of project structure and patterns
- Maintained awareness of critical dependencies and relationships
- Preserved knowledge of architectural constraints and conventions

**Success Criteria:**
- Claude Code suggestions consistent with existing architecture 95%+ of the time
- Zero architectural misconceptions or pattern violations
- Reliable dependency awareness across all interactions
- Consistent code quality aligned with project conventions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Architectural Intelligence Foundation
**Build the core architectural discovery and understanding engine**

**Components:**
- **Architectural Pattern Detection**: Identify project-specific patterns and conventions
- **Dependency Analysis**: Map critical relationships and structural dependencies
- **Query Classification**: Understand what type of architectural context each query needs
- **Context Optimization**: Package architectural understanding for economic delivery

### Phase 2: Query-Aware Context Engine
**Develop intelligent context supply based on specific queries**

**Components:**
- **Context Matching**: Match architectural context to query intent
- **Structural Prioritization**: Rank architectural information by relevance to current task
- **Economic Packaging**: Deliver maximum architectural insight with minimum tokens
- **Consistency Validation**: Ensure architectural context remains accurate and current

### Phase 3: Adaptive Architectural Intelligence
**Create self-improving architectural understanding that evolves with the codebase**

**Components:**
- **Pattern Evolution**: Track architectural changes and pattern updates
- **Context Learning**: Improve context relevance based on usage patterns
- **Architectural Health**: Monitor and maintain architectural context accuracy
- **Developer Feedback Integration**: Learn from corrections and architectural guidance

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience Metrics
- **Trust Improvement**: Developers rely on Claude Code architectural understanding 95%+ of the time
- **Friction Reduction**: 80-90% reduction in manual architectural explanation and correction
- **Development Velocity**: Faster development cycles with reliable architectural context
- **Code Quality**: Consistent adherence to project patterns and architectural constraints

### Technical Performance Metrics  
- **Context Accuracy**: Architectural context relevant to query 95%+ of the time
- **Economic Efficiency**: Essential architectural understanding delivered with <10% context window usage
- **Response Consistency**: Architectural context supply reliable across all query types
- **Adaptation Speed**: Architectural understanding updates within 24 hours of codebase changes

### System Health Metrics
- **Discovery Accuracy**: Critical architectural patterns identified correctly 95%+ of the time
- **Relationship Mapping**: Dependencies and structural relationships tracked accurately
- **Pattern Recognition**: Project-specific conventions understood and applied consistently
- **Context Freshness**: Architectural understanding reflects current codebase state

## Vision: Architecturally-Aware Claude Code

**The Future State**: Claude Code that intrinsically understands your project's architecture, patterns, and constraints - providing suggestions that always align with existing structure, respect critical dependencies, and maintain consistency with project conventions.

**The Developer Experience**: Work with Claude Code as a knowledgeable team member who deeply understands your architectural decisions and never suggests code that breaks your carefully designed patterns.

**The Technical Reality**: An intelligent architectural context engine that automatically and economically supplies the foundational understanding Claude Code needs to be a truly effective development partner.
