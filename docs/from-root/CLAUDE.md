# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Cortex V2.1** is a semantic code intelligence MCP server designed to enhance Claude Code's context window efficiency through intelligent code analysis and advanced relationship traversal. Provides 80-90% token reduction and reduces follow-up queries by 85%.

### Key Achievements
- **🎯 Advanced Relationship Traversal**: Multi-hop relationship discovery with complete context in single queries
- **🚀 ONNX Runtime Stability**: External Node.js processes with complete isolation and 10x parallelism  
- **💻 CPU + Memory Management**: Dual-resource monitoring preventing system overload (CPU: 69%/49%, Memory: 78%/69%)
- **🔄 Signal Cascade System**: Reliable parent-child process cleanup with zero orphaned processes
- **📊 Auto-sync Intelligence**: Eliminates manual storage commands with intelligent conflict resolution

## Quick Start Commands

### Essential Operations
```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm run startup        # Start server with health checks
npm run shutdown       # Clean shutdown with process cleanup
npm run health         # HTTP-based health check
```

### Server Modes
```bash
npm run server         # MCP server for Claude Code
npm run start:full     # Full indexing mode  
npm run start:cloudflare  # Cloud-based embedder (no local CPU/memory)
```

### Development & Testing
```bash
npm run demo           # Run indexing demo
npm run test:cpu-memory    # Test CPU + memory adaptive scaling
npm run test:cleanup   # Test process cleanup
npm run benchmark      # Performance benchmarking
```

## Critical Process Management

### 🧹 **Always Clean Up Interrupted Processes**
When interrupting any command (Ctrl+C, timeout, kill):
```bash
# Clean up both parent and child processes
pkill -f "npm.*demo\|ts-node.*index\|node.*external-embedding-process"
```

**Or use the automated cleanup:**
```bash
npm run shutdown  # Comprehensive cleanup script
```

### Process Types
- **Parent processes**: `npm run demo`, `ts-node src/index.ts`, `npm run benchmark`
- **Child processes**: `node src/external-embedding-process.js` (spawned by ProcessPoolEmbedder)
- **Memory impact**: Each external-embedding-process uses ~200-400MB

## CPU + Memory Adaptive Management

### Resource Thresholds
- **Memory**: Stop at 78%, Resume at 69% (prevents OOM)
- **CPU**: Stop at 69%, Resume at 49% (prevents system freeze)
- **Real-time monitoring**: Every 15 seconds, cross-platform

### 2-Step Adaptive Growth Algorithm
**Intelligent scaling that looks ahead 2 steps instead of projecting to theoretical maximum:**

1. **Current State**: Monitor actual resource usage with running processes
2. **Next Step Check**: Project memory usage for +1 process (must be < 78%)
3. **Two Step Safety**: Project memory usage for +2 processes (must be < 70%)
4. **CPU Headroom**: Current CPU usage must be < 55% (80% of 69% threshold)
5. **Growth Decision**: Only grow if all conditions met

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No premature throttling** - Doesn't delay growth based on theoretical maximum
- ✅ **Safety margin** - Two-step lookahead prevents resource exhaustion
- ✅ **Adaptive scaling** - Grows aggressively when resources permit
- ✅ **Real constraints** - Only slows down when approaching actual limits

### Resource Status Example (2-Step Adaptive Growth)
```
🟢 Memory: 4894MB used / 19838MB total (24.7%)
🟢 CPU: 1.6% used (16 cores, load: 2.32)
📊 Resource Projections (adaptive lookahead):
   Current: 2 processes using ~2447MB each (24.7%)
   Next step (3 processes): ~7341MB (37.0%)
   Two steps (4 processes): ~9788MB (49.3%)
   CPU cores available: 16 of 16
📈 Growth safe - Next: 37.0%, Two steps: 49.3%, CPU: 1.6%
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
EMBEDDER_TYPE=local       # ProcessPoolEmbedder with adaptive management (default)
EMBEDDER_TYPE=cloudflare  # Cloudflare AI embedder (no local resource usage)
```

## Performance Targets

- 🎯 **Cold start**: < 3 minutes (first run with model download)
- 🎯 **Warm start**: < 30 seconds (subsequent runs with cache)
- 🎯 **Memory usage**: < 78% threshold with adaptive scaling
- 🎯 **CPU usage**: < 69% threshold preventing system overload
- 🎯 **Process cleanup**: Zero orphaned processes after any exit
- 🎯 **Resource monitoring**: Real-time CPU + memory tracking every 15s

## Architecture Overview

### Current: Hybrid Local + Cloud Architecture
- **Local**: ProcessPoolEmbedder with CPU + memory adaptive management
- **Cloud**: Cloudflare Workers AI option
- **Storage**: Dual persistence (local `.cortex/` + global `~/.claude/`)
- **Auto-sync**: Intelligent conflict resolution and missing data recovery

### Data Flow
```
Claude Code ← MCP Server ← Vector Store ← Dual Storage + Auto-sync
     ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓
User Query → ProcessPool → Embeddings → Local + Global Storage
```

## Key Components

### Core System
- **server.ts** - MCP server with HTTP transport and startup tracking
- **indexer.ts** - Repository indexing with incremental support
- **process-pool-embedder.ts** - CPU + memory adaptive embedding generation
- **unified-storage-coordinator.ts** - Auto-sync dual storage management

### Resource Management
- **CPU monitoring**: Cross-platform detection (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- **Memory management**: Accurate system memory via native commands
- **Process cleanup**: Signal cascade with IPC + OS signal reliability
- **Adaptive scaling**: Growth decisions based on both CPU and memory

### Auto-sync Intelligence
- **Missing data resolution**: Syncs from available location automatically
- **Staleness detection**: Detects >24h apart and chooses newer version
- **Smart conflict resolution**: Timestamp-based synchronization
- **Eliminates manual commands**: No more `npm run storage:sync` needed

## MCP Server Integration

**Configuration for Claude Code** (`~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`):

- **Dual persistence**: Local (`.cortex/`) + Global (`~/.claude/`)  
- **Smart conflict resolution**: Newer timestamp wins
- **Zero manual intervention**: System handles synchronization intelligently
