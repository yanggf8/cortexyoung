# BGE Model and Cloudflare Vectorize Integration

## What is BGE Model?

BGE (BAAI General Embedding) is a family of text embedding models developed by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). Here's what you need to know about BGE models in the context of embeddings:

### What BGE Models Are

BGE models are **dense text embedding models** that convert text into high-dimensional vector representations. They're designed to capture semantic meaning, making them excellent for:

- **Semantic search** - Finding similar content based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Code understanding** - Capturing relationships between code snippets
- **Information retrieval** - Matching queries to relevant documents

### BGE Model Variants

The BGE family includes several sizes:
- **BGE-small-en-v1.5** (384 dimensions) - What Cortex uses
- **BGE-base-en-v1.5** (768 dimensions) 
- **BGE-large-en-v1.5** (1024 dimensions)

### Why Cortex Uses BGE-small-en-v1.5

Cortex specifically chose BGE-small-en-v1.5 because:

1. **Efficiency**: 384 dimensions provide good semantic understanding while being computationally lightweight
2. **Local inference**: Runs entirely in Node.js via fastembed-js without external API calls
3. **Performance**: Achieving 91ms average per chunk including ML inference
4. **Size**: ~200MB model that caches locally in `.fastembed_cache/`

### How It Works in Cortex

```
Code Chunks → BGE-small-en-v1.5 → 384-dim vectors → Vector DB → Semantic Search
```

This enables Cortex to:
- Understand code semantically rather than just syntactically
- Find related code through meaning, not just text matching
- Reduce Claude Code's token waste from 50-70% to much more efficient context

## Cloudflare Vectorize Integration

Using BGE embeddings **should not impact** your use of Cloudflare Vectorize, but there are some important considerations:

### Compatibility

**✅ BGE-small-en-v1.5 works with Vectorize**
- BGE produces 384-dimensional vectors
- Vectorize supports up to 1,536 dimensions
- No compatibility issues

### Key Considerations

#### 1. Embedding Consistency
You need to use the **same embedding model** for both:
- **Indexing**: When storing vectors in Vectorize
- **Querying**: When searching for similar vectors

If Cortex generates embeddings locally with BGE, you'll need to:
```javascript
// Generate query embedding with same BGE model
const queryEmbedding = await generateBGEEmbedding(searchQuery);

// Search Vectorize with that embedding
const results = await vectorize.query(queryEmbedding);
```

#### 2. Architecture Options

**Option A: Hybrid Approach**
- Cortex generates embeddings locally (fast, private)
- Store vectors in Vectorize (scalable, distributed)
- Best of both worlds

**Option B: Full Vectorize**
- Generate embeddings server-side before storing
- Use Vectorize for both storage and embedding generation
- Simpler but requires API calls

#### 3. Performance Trade-offs

**Local BGE (Current Cortex)**
- ✅ 91ms per chunk locally
- ✅ No API latency
- ✅ Works offline
- ❌ Limited to single machine

**Vectorize Integration**
- ✅ Distributed storage
- ✅ Scalable queries
- ❌ Network latency
- ❌ API rate limits

## Recommendation

For your Cortex project, consider a **hybrid approach**:

1. Keep BGE local for development and fast iteration
2. Optionally sync embeddings to Vectorize for production scale
3. Use the same BGE model everywhere for consistency

This gives you the speed benefits of local embeddings while maintaining the option to scale with Vectorize when needed.

## Implementation Notes

The BGE model is what powers Cortex's **semantic memory** - allowing it to understand relationships between code pieces and provide more intelligent context to Claude Code. This semantic understanding is key to achieving the 80-90% token reduction that Cortex targets.
