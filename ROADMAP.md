# Cortex MCP Server Development Roadmap

## Current Status âœ…
- [x] MCP Server Implementation (HTTP transport)
- [x] Official MCP SDK integration
- [x] JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance
- [x] Three core tools: semantic_search, contextual_read, code_intelligence
- [x] MCP Inspector testing and validation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

## Phase 1: Claude Code Integration ðŸŽ¯
**Target: Immediate (Next 1-2 days)**

### Tasks
- [ ] Connect Cortex server to Claude Code
- [ ] Test semantic_search tool integration
- [ ] Test contextual_read with real file paths  
- [ ] Test code_intelligence with analysis tasks
- [ ] Validate error handling and edge cases

### Success Criteria
- All three tools accessible via `@cortex-server/` in Claude Code
- Tools provide useful, accurate responses
- Error cases handled gracefully

## Phase 2: Production Readiness ðŸš€
**Target: 1-2 weeks**

### Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Input parameter validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP codes
- [ ] Request timeout handling (30s default)
- [ ] Graceful degradation when embeddings unavailable

### Security & Performance
- [ ] Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per client
- [ ] API key authentication (optional)
- [ ] Request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for large codebases
- [ ] Vector database connection pooling

### Deployment
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] systemd service configuration
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

## Phase 3: MCP Ecosystem Expansion ðŸ“¡
**Target: 2-4 weeks**

### Database Integration
- [ ] PostgreSQL MCP server for persistent data
- [ ] Store search history and analytics
- [ ] User preferences and configurations
- [ ] Code analysis results caching

### External Services
- [ ] GitHub MCP server for repository operations
- [ ] Filesystem MCP server for file operations
- [ ] Multi-server workflow orchestration
- [ ] Cross-server data sharing

### Enhanced Tooling
- [ ] Batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Scheduled analysis tasks
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Configuration management UI

## Phase 4: Advanced Features âš¡
**Target: 1-3 months**

### Enhanced Code Intelligence
- [ ] Multi-repository analysis
- [ ] Code dependency mapping and visualization
- [ ] Automated refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Security vulnerability detection
- [ ] Performance bottleneck identification

### Collaborative Features
- [ ] Team shared contexts and workspaces
- [ ] Code review automation
- [ ] Automated documentation generation
- [ ] Change impact analysis
- [ ] Knowledge base integration

### Integration Ecosystem

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration
- [ ] Slack/Discord bot notifications
- [ ] Custom webhook support
- [ ] REST API for third-party integrations

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
**Ongoing**

### Code Quality
- [ ] Unit test coverage (target: 80%+)
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Code documentation improvements
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup

- [ ] User feedback collected and addressed

### Phase 2 Metrics
- [ ] 99.9% uptime achieved
- [ ] Response time < 2s for most queries
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Deployment automation working

### Phase 3 Metrics
- [ ] 5+ MCP servers integrated
- [ ] Multi-server workflows functioning
- [ ] Advanced search capabilities
- [ ] Team collaboration features

### Phase 4 Metrics
- [ ] 10+ third-party integrations
- [ ] Advanced analytics available
- [ ] Community adoption growing
- [ ] Enterprise features ready

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Vector DB scalability**: Monitor performance, implement sharding
- **Memory usage**: Implement caching strategies and limits
- **API rate limits**: Add queuing and throttling mechanisms

### Business Risks
- **Competition**: Focus on unique code intelligence features
- **Adoption**: Ensure excellent documentation and examples
- **Maintenance**: Build sustainable development practices

## Resources Required

### Phase 1
- **Time**: 1-2 developer days
- **Infrastructure**: Current setup sufficient
- **Tools**: Claude Code access for testing

### Phase 2
- **Time**: 1-2 developer weeks
- **Infrastructure**: Production server, monitoring tools
- **Tools**: Docker, monitoring stack

### Phase 3
- **Time**: 2-4 developer weeks
- **Infrastructure**: Database server, external services
- **Tools**: Multiple MCP servers, orchestration

### Phase 4
- **Time**: 1-3 developer months
- **Infrastructure**: Scalable cloud deployment
- **Tools**: Advanced analytics, ML models
