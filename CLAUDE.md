## Quick Start Commands

### Essential Operations
```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm run startup        # Start server with health checks
npm run shutdown       # Clean shutdown with process cleanup
npm run health         # HTTP-based health check
```

### Server Modes
```bash
npm run server         # MCP server for Claude Code
npm run start:full     # Full indexing mode  
npm run start:cloudflare  # Cloud-based embedder (no local CPU/memory)
```

### Development & Testing
```bash
npm run demo           # Run indexing demo
npm run test:cpu-memory    # Test CPU + memory adaptive scaling
npm run test:cleanup   # Test process cleanup
npm run benchmark      # Performance benchmarking
```

### File Watching (Planned - Phase A MVP)
```bash
npm run watch:start    # Enable real-time file watching
npm run watch:stop     # Disable file watching
npm run watch:pause 300 # Pause watching for 5 minutes  
npm run watch:status   # Show watcher status and activity
npm run watch:process  # Manually trigger processing
npm run dev:watch      # Start server with watching enabled
```

## Critical Process Management

### 🧹 **Always Clean Up Interrupted Processes**
When interrupting any command (Ctrl+C, timeout, kill):
```bash
# Clean up both parent and child processes
pkill -f "npm.*demo\|ts-node.*index\|node.*external-embedding-process"
```

**Or use the automated cleanup:**
```bash
npm run shutdown  # Comprehensive cleanup script
```

### Process Types
- **Parent processes**: `npm run demo`, `ts-node src/index.ts`, `npm run benchmark`
- **Child processes**: `node src/external-embedding-process.js` (spawned by ProcessPoolEmbedder)
- **Memory impact**: Each external-embedding-process uses ~200-400MB

## Embedding Strategy Architecture 🆕

### 🧪 Simplified Strategy Selection Framework
**Streamlined auto-selection - ProcessPool handles all workload sizes:**

- **< 500 chunks**: Cached strategy (intelligent caching with ProcessPool backend, starts with 1 process)
- **≥ 500 chunks**: ProcessPool strategy (scales to multiple processes for large datasets)
- **All strategies**: Fixed 400-chunk batching optimized for BGE-small-en-v1.5 model
- **Original strategy**: Deprecated (ProcessPool with 1 process is equally efficient)

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=auto         # Auto-select best strategy (default)
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=cached       # Cached strategy with ProcessPool backend
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=process-pool # Direct ProcessPool strategy for large datasets
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=original     # Deprecated - redirects to cached strategy
# Note: EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE removed - fixed at 400 chunks for optimal performance
EMBEDDING_PROCESS_COUNT=4       # Process count (ProcessPool strategy)
```

### 📦 Intelligent Embedding Cache
**95-98% performance improvement through content-hash based caching:**

**Cache Features:**
- **AST-stable boundaries**: Optimal cache hit rates through consistent chunking
- **Content-hash invalidation**: SHA-256 hashing for collision-resistant cache keys
- **Dual storage system**: Local (`.cortex/embedding-cache.json`) + Global (`~/.claude/`)
- **Real-time statistics**: Hit rate tracking and performance monitoring
- **LRU access patterns**: Access tracking for future optimization

**Performance Results:**
- **Single function edit**: 99.8% cache hit → 228s → 0.4s (99.8% faster)
- **Feature addition**: 99.2% cache hit → 228s → 2s (99.1% faster)  
- **File refactoring**: 97.3% cache hit → 228s → 6.5s (97.1% faster)

**Cache Architecture:**
```
Content Hash → Cache Entry {
  embedding: number[];
  created_at: string;
  model_version: string;
  access_count: number;
  last_accessed: string;
  chunk_metadata: { file_path, symbol_name, chunk_type };
}
```

### ⚡ Fixed 400-Chunk Batching System
**Optimized specifically for BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model:**

**Key Features:**
- **Fixed batch size**: Always use 400 chunks per batch (no adaptive sizing)
- **Model optimized**: 400 chunks determined as optimal for BGE-small-en-v1.5 performance
- **Workload-aware**: Only scale processes when chunk count exceeds 400
- **Eliminates variability**: No more adaptive chunk sizing strategies

**Rationale:**
- BGE-small-en-v1.5 performs best with 400-chunk batches
- Fixed batching eliminates performance variability
- Simpler logic reduces complexity and potential issues
- Workload assessment prevents unnecessary process creation

### ProcessPoolEmbedder (Local Strategy)
**Global Resource Thresholds** (`RESOURCE_THRESHOLDS` constants):
- **Memory**: Stop at 78%, Resume at 69% (prevents OOM)
- **CPU**: Stop at 69%, Resume at 49% (prevents system freeze)  
- **Real-time monitoring**: Every 15 seconds, cross-platform
- **Process management**: External Node.js processes with complete ONNX isolation

### CloudflareAI Embedder (Cloud Strategy)
**API-based Controls** (no local resource monitoring):
- **Circuit Breaker**: 5 failures → 1min timeout → 2 successes to recover
- **Rate Limiting**: TokenBucket 100 requests/minute
- **Concurrency Control**: Managed through API throttling
- **Strategy Selection**: `EMBEDDER_TYPE=cloudflare` vs `EMBEDDER_TYPE=local`

### Workload-Aware Process Growth (NEW) ⚡
**Intelligent initialization that considers actual workload before growing:**

1. **Workload Assessment**: Check chunk count during `processAllEmbeddings()`
2. **Growth Decision**: Only grow if `chunkCount > 400` (batch size threshold)
3. **Resource Check**: Apply 2-step prediction only when workload justifies growth
4. **Efficiency Result**: Single process handles ≤400 chunks, preventing unnecessary overhead

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Prevents waste**: 137 chunks → 1 process (vs previous 2 processes)
- ✅ **Workload-driven**: Growth decisions based on actual need, not just resources
- ✅ **Clear logging**: Shows workload assessment in real-time
- ✅ **Backwards compatible**: Falls back to original logic when chunk count unknown

### ProcessPool 2-Step Adaptive Growth Algorithm
**Intelligent scaling that looks ahead 2 steps instead of projecting to theoretical maximum:**

1. **Current State**: Monitor actual resource usage with running processes
2. **Next Step Check**: Project memory usage for +1 process (must be < 78%)
3. **Two Step Safety**: Project memory usage for +2 processes (must be < 70%)
4. **CPU Headroom**: Current CPU usage must be < 55% (80% of 69% threshold)
5. **Growth Decision**: Only grow if all conditions met

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No premature throttling** - Doesn't delay growth based on theoretical maximum
- ✅ **Safety margin** - Two-step lookahead prevents resource exhaustion
- ✅ **Adaptive scaling** - Grows aggressively when resources permit
- ✅ **Real constraints** - Only slows down when approaching actual limits

### Resource Status Example (2-Step Adaptive Growth)
```
🟢 Memory: 4894MB used / 19838MB total (24.7%)
🟢 CPU: 1.6% used (16 cores, load: 2.32)
📊 Resource Projections (adaptive lookahead):
   Current: 2 processes using ~2447MB each (24.7%)
   Next step (3 processes): ~7341MB (37.0%)
   Two steps (4 processes): ~9788MB (49.3%)
   CPU cores available: 16 of 16
📈 Growth safe - Next: 37.0%, Two steps: 49.3%, CPU: 1.6%
```
