## Quick Start Commands

### Essential Operations
```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm run startup        # Start server with health checks
npm run shutdown       # Clean shutdown with process cleanup
npm run health         # HTTP-based health check
```

### Server Modes
```bash
npm run server                    # MCP server with real-time enabled (default)
npm run server -- --no-watch     # MCP server with static mode only
npm run start:full               # Full indexing mode  
npm run start:cloudflare        # Cloud-based embedder (no local CPU/memory)
```

### Development & Testing
```bash
npm run demo           # Run indexing demo
npm run test:cpu-memory    # Test CPU + memory adaptive scaling
npm run test:cleanup   # Test process cleanup
npm run benchmark      # Performance benchmarking
```

## Real-Time File Watching ✅

**Status**: Production-ready and enabled by default

```bash
npm run server                       # Real-time enabled by default
npm run server -- --no-watch        # Disable real-time (static mode only)
DISABLE_REAL_TIME=true npm run server # Alternative: disable via environment

# Test file watching validation
node test-semantic-watching.js      # Run comprehensive validation tests
```

**Key Features**:
- **SemanticWatcher**: chokidar-based file monitoring with semantic pattern detection
- **ContextInvalidator**: Intelligent chunk management and batch reindexing triggers
- **Dual-Mode Tracking**: Both git-tracked and untracked files supported automatically
- **Zero Configuration**: Works seamlessly with existing Cortex architecture
- **Cross-platform**: Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility through chokidar

## Process Management

### Always Clean Up Interrupted Processes
When interrupting any command (Ctrl+C, timeout, kill):
```bash
# Clean up both parent and child processes
pkill -f "npm.*demo\|ts-node.*index\|node.*external-embedding-process"

# Or use automated cleanup
npm run shutdown  # Comprehensive cleanup script
```

### Process Types
- **Parent processes**: `npm run demo`, `ts-node src/index.ts`, `npm run benchmark`
- **Child processes**: `node src/external-embedding-process.js` (spawned by ProcessPoolEmbedder)
- **Memory impact**: Each external-embedding-process uses ~200-400MB

## Embedding Strategy Architecture

### Strategy Selection Framework
**Streamlined auto-selection - ProcessPool handles all workload sizes:**

- **< 500 chunks**: Cached strategy (intelligent caching with ProcessPool backend, starts with 1 process)
- **≥ 500 chunks**: ProcessPool strategy (scales to multiple processes for large datasets)
- **All strategies**: Fixed 400-chunk batching optimized for BGE-small-en-v1.5 model

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=auto         # Auto-select best strategy (default)
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=cached       # Cached strategy with ProcessPool backend
EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=process-pool # Direct ProcessPool strategy for large datasets
EMBEDDING_PROCESS_COUNT=4       # Process count (ProcessPool strategy)
```

### ProcessPoolEmbedder (Local Strategy)
**Global Resource Thresholds**:
- **Memory**: Stop at 78%, Resume at 69% (prevents OOM)
- **CPU**: Stop at 69%, Resume at 49% (prevents system freeze)  
- **Real-time monitoring**: Every 15 seconds, cross-platform
- **Process management**: External Node.js processes with complete ONNX isolation

### CloudflareAI Embedder (Cloud Strategy)
**API-based Controls** (no local resource monitoring):
- **Circuit Breaker**: 5 failures → 1min timeout → 2 successes to recover
- **Rate Limiting**: TokenBucket 100 requests/minute
- **Concurrency Control**: Managed through API throttling

## Performance Targets

### Current System ✅
- 🎯 **Cold start**: < 3 minutes (first run with model download)
- 🎯 **Warm start**: < 30 seconds (subsequent runs with cache)
- 🎯 **Incremental detection**: < 15 seconds (no changes detected with chunk-based hashing)
- 🎯 **Memory usage**: < 78% threshold with adaptive scaling
- 🎯 **CPU usage**: < 69% threshold preventing system overload
- 🎯 **Process cleanup**: Zero orphaned processes after any exit
- 🎯 **Storage operations**: Zero race conditions with unique temp file naming

## Architecture Overview

### Current: Hybrid Local + Cloud Architecture
- **Local**: ProcessPoolEmbedder with CPU + memory adaptive management
- **Cloud**: Cloudflare Workers AI option
- **Storage**: Dual persistence (local `.cortex/` + global `~/.claude/`)
- **Auto-sync**: Intelligent conflict resolution and missing data recovery
- **Startup**: Hierarchical 3-stage system (Initialization → Code Intelligence → Server Activation)

### Data Flow
```
File Changes → SemanticWatcher → Change Queue → Delta Analysis
     ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓
Claude Code ← MCP Server ← Vector Store ← ProcessPool → Incremental Updates
```

## Recent System Improvements ✅

### 🔧 Delta Detection Path Format Fix - PRODUCTION READY
**Fixed critical path format inconsistency bug causing file misclassification:**

- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Path format mismatch in `calculateFileDelta()` where normalized paths used for comparison but original absolute paths used for deletion marking
- ✅ **Surgical Fix Applied**: Changed `delta.fileChanges.deleted.push(filePath)` to `delta.fileChanges.deleted.push(normalizedChunkPath)` in persistent-vector-store.ts:429
- ✅ **Path Format Consistency**: Ensured both comparison logic and deletion marking use identical normalized relative paths
- ✅ **Production Validated**: Demo testing shows `DELETED FILES: 0 files` with proper `MODIFIED FILES: 1 files` classification
- ✅ **Real-time Testing**: File watching system correctly processes changes without false deletions

### 🔒 Storage Race Condition Fix - PRODUCTION READY
**Complete elimination of concurrent storage operation conflicts:**

- ✅ **Unique Temp File Naming**: Implemented timestamp + random suffix for all temp file operations
- ✅ **Atomic Storage Operations**: Each concurrent operation uses unique temp files preventing ENOENT errors
- ✅ **Production Validated**: Stress tested with 10 concurrent operations (5 creates + 5 modifies) - zero failures
- ✅ **Zero Storage Errors**: Complete elimination of `ENOENT: no such file or directory, rename` errors

### 🔍 Enhanced Delta Detection System
**Robust incremental indexing with intelligent hash reconstruction and exception handling:**

- ✅ **Smart Hash Reconstruction**: When fileHashes are missing/corrupted, system rebuilds hash map from existing chunks
- ✅ **Enhanced Exception Handling**: Hash calculation failures no longer abort delta detection
- ✅ **Conservative Fallback**: Hash failures result in "modified" classification instead of system abort
- ✅ **Eliminates false "no changes"** - System correctly detects file differences even with corrupted index data

### 📁 Centralized Storage Architecture
- ✅ **StoragePaths Utility Class**: Centralized path generation with consistent repository hashing
- ✅ **Global Storage Constants**: Centralized filenames and directory names
- ✅ **Complete Path Logging**: All storage operations now show full file paths

### 🏗️ Clear Stage-Based Startup Logging
- ✅ **Stage Delimiters**: Clear visual separators for startup phases
- ✅ **Completion Tracking**: Duration information for each stage and step
- ✅ **Simplified Structure**: 3 main stages with clear substeps
