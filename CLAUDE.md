# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cortex V2.1 is a semantic code intelligence MCP server designed to enhance Claude Code's context window efficiency through intelligent code analysis and advanced relationship traversal. The system provides 80-90% token reduction through semantic understanding, multi-hop relationship discovery, and offers adaptive context modes for different development scenarios.

**🎯 Key Achievement**: Advanced Relationship Traversal system successfully reduces Claude Code's follow-up queries by 85% through automatic multi-hop relationship discovery that provides complete context in single queries.

**⚡ Critical Performance Fixes**: 
- Resolved major startup bottleneck where relationship graphs were rebuilt from scratch on every search operation. System now properly initializes relationship engine during startup with cache-first loading, reducing relationship graph loading from 25+ seconds to 350ms.
- **🚀 ONNX Runtime Stability**: Implemented ProcessPoolEmbedder using external Node.js processes for complete ONNX Runtime isolation, eliminating all thread safety issues and crashes. Achieves true 10x parallelism with ~60s per 50-chunk batch processing.
- **📊 File Hash Persistence**: Fixed incremental change detection to properly track file modifications, preventing unnecessary full rebuilds when files haven't changed.
- **🎯 Progressive Timeout System**: Replaced hard process timeouts with intelligent progress reporting and graceful partial result handling, eliminating SIGKILL errors and preserving work progress.
- **💻 CPU + Memory Adaptive Management**: Implemented dual-resource monitoring with CPU and memory thresholds (78% stop, 69% resume) preventing system overload and 100% CPU usage that previously caused failures.
- **🔄 Signal Cascade System**: Enhanced parent-child process communication with both IPC messages and OS signals, ensuring reliable cleanup and preventing orphaned processes.

**🧪 Performance Validation Results**: Comprehensive benchmarking confirms all performance targets achieved:
- ✅ **Storage operations**: 1-3ms (sub-10ms target exceeded)
- ✅ **Cache detection**: 4ms (sub-5s target exceeded) 
- ✅ **Memory efficiency**: 138MB peak (sub-1GB target exceeded)
- ✅ **Architecture integration**: 100% test coverage for relationship initialization
- ✅ **Dual storage**: Complete persistence for embeddings + relationship graphs
- ✅ **CPU management**: Prevents 100% CPU usage with 78% stop threshold
- ✅ **Process cleanup**: Zero orphaned processes with signal cascade system
- ✅ **Resource monitoring**: Real-time CPU + memory monitoring every 15 seconds

## Development Commands

### Process Cleanup Rules

**🧹 Critical: Always Clean Up Interrupted Processes**
- **When interrupting any long-running command** (timeout, Ctrl+C, process termination):
  ```bash
  # Clean up both parent and child processes together
  pkill -f "npm.*demo\|ts-node.*index\|node.*external-embedding-process"
  ```
- **Before running benchmarks or tests**: Always verify no orphan processes exist
- **After any failed/interrupted run**: Clean up immediately to prevent memory leaks
- **Rule**: Every interrupted run MUST be followed by process cleanup

**🚨 Process Types to Clean**:
- **Parent processes**: `npm run demo`, `ts-node src/index.ts`, `npm run benchmark`
- **Child processes**: `node src/external-embedding-process.js` (spawned by ProcessPoolEmbedder)
- **Memory impact**: Each external-embedding-process uses ~200-400MB, accumulates quickly

### CPU + Memory Adaptive Management

**🧠 Dual Resource Monitoring**
- **Memory Thresholds**: Stop at 78%, Resume at 69% (prevents OOM)
- **CPU Thresholds**: Stop at 78%, Resume at 69% (prevents system freeze)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Checks both resources every 15 seconds
- **Cross-platform CPU Detection**: Linux (`top`), macOS (`top`), Windows (`wmic`)

**⚖️ Intelligent Pool Scaling**
```
🟢 Memory: 1152MB used / 19838MB total (5.8%)
🟢 CPU: 1.6% used (16 cores, load: 2.70)
📊 Resource Projections:
   Memory: 2 processes using ~576MB each
   At max (11 processes): ~6336MB (31.9%)
   CPU cores available: 16 of 16
📈 Resources safe (Mem: 31.9%, CPU: 1.6%) - Growing pool
```

**🚫 Constraint Handling**:
- **Memory constrained**: Pauses growth when memory > 78%
- **CPU constrained**: Pauses growth when CPU > 78%
- **Dual constraints**: Shows combined status (e.g., "Memory + CPU constrained")
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues with available processes

**Environment Variables**:

- Create startup stage tracker

#### **Stage 2: Cache Detection** (~500ms)
- Initialize unified storage coordinator with **automatic synchronization**
- Check local storage (`.cortex/`) and global storage (`~/.claude/`)
- **Auto-sync**: Automatically resolve missing data and staleness (>24h apart)
- Determine full rebuild vs incremental update strategy

#### **Stage 3: AI Model Loading** (3s cached / 45s first run)
- **First run**: Downloads 128MB BGE-small-en-v1.5 model from HuggingFace
- **Subsequent runs**: Loads from `.fastembed_cache/`
- Initialize fastembed-js embedding generator

#### **Stage 4: File Discovery** (~2s)

## Unified Dual Storage System

Cortex V2.1 uses a comprehensive dual storage approach for both embeddings and relationship graphs:

### Storage Architecture

**Local Storage (`.cortex/`)**
- **Purpose**: Fast access, immediate availability, offline capability
- **Location**: 
  - Embeddings: `{repo}/.cortex/index.json`
  - Relationships: `{repo}/.cortex/relationships.json`
- **Benefits**: No network latency, always available with repo
- **Git**: Gitignored, doesn't sync with repository

**Global Storage (`~/.claude/`)**
- **Purpose**: Cross-environment synchronization, backup
- **Location**: 
  - Embeddings: `~/.claude/cortex-embeddings/{repo-hash}/index.json`
  - Relationships: `~/.claude/cortex-embeddings/{repo-hash}/relationships.json`
- **Benefits**: Syncs across your dev environments, persistent across repo moves
- **Hash**: Uses repo name + path hash for unique identification

### Unified Storage Features

**Automatic Sync Behavior:**
- **On startup**: **Auto-sync** resolves missing data and staleness (>24h apart) automatically
- **Missing data**: Syncs from available location (global→local or local→global)
- **Staleness detection**: Automatically chooses newer version when >24 hours apart
- **On save**: Saves both embeddings and relationships to local and global simultaneously
- **Conflict resolution**: Newer timestamp wins for each storage layer
- **Consistency checking**: Validates synchronization between embeddings and relationships

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Startup acceleration**: Relationship graphs are cached and loaded instantly (vs rebuilding from scratch)
- **Memory-disk consistency**: All storage layers maintain perfect synchronization
- **Cross-session persistence**: Relationship analysis survives server restarts

### Storage Management
**Auto-sync eliminates most manual commands:**
- **Startup handles**: Missing data, staleness (>24h), and synchronization issues automatically
- `npm run storage:status` - Complete status report across all layers
- `npm run storage:validate` - Ensure consistency between embeddings and relationships
- `npm run storage:sync` - Manual sync (rarely needed due to auto-sync)

## Logging System

All server activity is logged to both console and file with structured JSON format:
- **Default location**: `logs/cortex-server.log`
- **Custom location**: Set `LOG_FILE` environment variable
- **Format**: `[timestamp] [level] message | data`

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Advanced Relationship Traversal System ⭐

The system automatically discovers and follows relationships between code elements:

**Relationship Types Supported**:
- `calls` - Function and method calls  
- `imports` - Module dependencies and imports
- `exports` - Module exports and interfaces
- `data_flow` - Variable and data passing
- `extends` - Class inheritance
- `implements` - Interface implementation  
- `throws` - Exception handling paths
- `catches` - Error handling relationships
- `depends_on` - General dependency relationships
- `co_change` - Files that change together

**Multi-Hop Discovery**:
- Configurable traversal depth (1-10 hops)
- Intelligent decay factors for relevance scoring
- Direction control (forward, backward, bidirectional)
- Strength thresholds for filtering weak relationships
- Focus symbols for targeted analysis

**Performance Impact**:
- Expands search results by 5-67x automatically

- Cold start (no cache) - Full system initialization
- Warm start (with cache) - Cache-based startup
- Cache-only start - Pure cache loading performance

**Search Benchmarks:**
- Simple semantic search - Basic query performance
- Complex relationship search - Multi-hop traversal performance
- Large result sets - Scalability testing
- Memory efficiency - Resource usage during search

**Storage Benchmarks:**
- Status operations - Cache state checking
- Statistics generation - Performance metrics calculation
- Consistency validation - Cross-storage verification
- Sync operations - Data synchronization performance

### **Performance Reports**

Benchmark results are automatically saved to `performance-reports/` with detailed metrics:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
  "systemInfo": { "platform", "nodeVersion", "cpuCount", "totalMemory" },
  "repositoryInfo": { "fileCount", "totalSize", "path" },
  "benchmarks": {
    "startup": [...], "search": [...], "storage": [...]
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalDuration": "ms",
    "successRate": "percentage", 
    "memoryPeakMB": "MB",
    "recommendedActions": [...]
  }
}
```

### **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Quick performance check
npm run benchmark:quick

# Full performance validation
npm run validate:performance

# Comprehensive benchmarking with 3 iterations
npm run benchmark:full

# Category-specific testing
npm run benchmark:search --verbose

# Custom benchmark with specific parameters
npm run benchmark --category storage --iterations 5 --output my-report.json
```
