# Cortex V2.1 - Semantic Code Intelligence for Claude Code

A semantic code intelligence server designed to enhance Claude Code's context window efficiency through intelligent code analysis and multi-hop relationship traversal.

## Overview

Cortex V2.1 addresses Claude Code's primary limitation: **50-70% token waste** due to manual, text-based code discovery. Our system provides:

- **80-90% token reduction** through semantic understanding
- **Multi-hop relationship traversal** for complete context discovery  
- **MCP server architecture** for seamless Claude Code integration
- **Adaptive context modes** balancing structure vs flexibility

## Architecture

**Pure Node.js System** with local ML inference:

### Core Components

```
Claude Code ← Node.js MCP Server ← fastembed-js (BGE model)
     ↓                ↓                      ↓
User Query → Git Scanner/Chunker → Local Embeddings → Vector DB
```

**Single Process**: Git operations, chunking, embeddings, MCP server, Claude integration  
**Local ML**: BGE-small-en-v1.5 model via fastembed-js (384 dimensions)

### Key Features

- **Semantic Memory**: Embeddings + AST chunking for code understanding
- **Multi-hop Retrieval**: Follow calls → imports → data flow → co-change patterns
- **Adaptive Orchestration**: Minimal | Structured | Adaptive context modes
- **Token Efficiency**: Pre-filtered, relevant code chunks

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run demo (downloads BGE model on first run)
npm run demo
```

**First run**: Downloads ~200MB BGE-small-en-v1.5 model to `.fastembed_cache/`  
**Subsequent runs**: Uses cached model for instant startup

### Bug Fixes

**v2.1.6 - Performance & Concurrency Optimizations** 🆕
- **⚡ Parallel Operations**: Vector store initialization now uses Promise.all for concurrent directory creation and file operations
- **🚀 Smart Health Checks**: New `quickHealthCheck()` method avoids expensive validation when index is healthy
- **🔄 Concurrent Processing**: Relationship building now runs in parallel with embedding generation for faster indexing
- **📊 Streaming Embeddings**: Large datasets (>100 chunks) use streaming generation with batched storage for memory efficiency
- **🧠 Intelligent Startup**: Quick health checks before detailed analysis, reducing startup time for healthy indexes
- **🔧 Enhanced Logging**: Improved argument handling in logging utilities with better error reporting
- **💾 Background Sync**: Storage synchronization operations now run in background to avoid blocking startup

**v2.1.5 - Complete Timestamp Coverage**
- **🕐 Fixed missing ISO timestamps**: All startup logs now have consistent `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ]` timestamps
- **📝 Enhanced logging consistency**: Updated 5 core files (index.ts, startup-stages.ts, hierarchical-stages.ts, git-scanner.ts, persistent-relationship-store.ts)
- **🔧 Improved debugging experience**: Complete timestamp coverage for relationship graph loading, git operations, and storage sync
- **⚡ Maintained performance**: Zero impact on startup time while adding comprehensive timestamp tracking
- **🧹 Unified logging architecture**: All console fallbacks now use timestamped logging utilities

**v2.1.4 - Simplified ProcessPool Architecture**
- **⚡ Removed redundant original strategy**: ProcessPool with 1 process handles all workload sizes efficiently  
- **🔧 Fixed 400-chunk batching**: No adaptive sizing - always use optimal batch size for BGE-small-en-v1.5
- **🧹 Streamlined strategy selection**: Auto-selection now chooses between cached (<500) and process-pool (≥500)
- **📋 Improved workload management**: Only scale processes when chunk count justifies multiple processes  
- **🔄 Legacy compatibility**: Original strategy gracefully redirects to cached with deprecation warning
- **📝 Accurate cleanup messaging**: No more misleading "process pool cleanup" when no processes were created

**v2.1.3 - Intelligent Embedding Cache & Strategy Selection**
- **📦 Intelligent Embedding Cache**: 95-98% performance improvement with content-hash based caching
  - AST-stable chunk boundaries for optimal cache hit rates  
  - Dual storage system (local + global) with automatic synchronization
  - Real-time hit rate tracking and performance monitoring
  - Content invalidation using SHA-256 hashing for collision resistance
- **🧪 Simplified Strategy Selection Framework**: Streamlined auto-selection with ProcessPool backend
  - `< 500 chunks`: Cached strategy (intelligent caching + ProcessPool, starts with 1 process)
  - `≥ 500 chunks`: ProcessPool strategy (scales to multiple processes)
  - **Original strategy deprecated**: ProcessPool with 1 process handles all workload sizes efficiently
  - **Fixed 400-chunk batching**: All strategies use optimal batch size for BGE-small-en-v1.5 model  
  - Environment variable overrides: `EMBEDDING_STRATEGY=auto|cached|process-pool` (original→cached)
- **Performance Results**: Single function edit 228s → 0.4s, Feature addition 228s → 2s, File refactoring 228s → 6.5s

**v2.1.2 - Incremental Indexing Logic Fixes**
- Fixed overly aggressive automatic full indexing that incorrectly discarded valid embeddings
- Corrected delta analysis to handle NEW, MODIFIED, and DELETED files independently
- Removed problematic automatic mode switching based on flawed percentage thresholds
- Ensured incremental mode is always used except for: first time, user explicit request, or complete corruption
- Fixed file hash population bug that prevented proper delta calculation
- Improved embedding preservation - system now keeps 57.9% valid embeddings instead of reprocessing everything
- Simplified file hash architecture - removed unnecessary validation and misleading warnings
- File hashes are rebuilt on startup by design (fast & always accurate, no persistence complexity)

**v2.1.1 - Indexing Robustness**
- Fixed ENOENT errors when processing deleted files during incremental indexing
- Enhanced Git scanner to properly filter out deleted files in both full and incremental scans
- Improved error handling and logging for better debugging experience
- Ensured consistent file existence validation across all scanning modes

## ChatGPT Architecture Analysis

Based on architectural review, we've incorporated:

1. **✅ Memory-based approach**: Semantic embeddings over syntax trees
2. **✅ Multi-hop retrieval**: Relationship traversal vs flat KNN
3. **⚠️ Adaptive orchestration**: Balanced approach vs purely minimal

See `architecture-analysis.md` for detailed evaluation.

## Integration with Claude Code

Cortex provides semantic tools via MCP server:

- `semantic_search` → Enhanced code search with vector embeddings
- `contextual_read` → File reading with semantic context awareness
